# Power

## Panel

There are two 120V 20A breakers in the main panel that feed each UPS.

## UPS

For power protection, two Eaton 9PX2000RT UPSes are used. These are online/double-conversion units, capable of handling 1800W each.

These feed clean, uninterrupted, power to every device in the rack.

## PDU

For power distribution, two APC 8858 PDUs are used.

## Generator

In the event of a power outage, each UPS can sustain the average load for around 20 minutes.

The generator automatically kicks in within 15 seconds of a full utility power outage.
